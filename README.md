Solutions from freeCodeCamp challenges

I decided to make a repo of my solutions to the freeCodeCamp challenges.
Most of the challenges are short and trivial but none the less I might find it useful to direct people to some concepts or problems once I complete the whole thing and all of the certs.

If you wanna see the challenges and their setup visit: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/
